# 👋 Hi there! I'm Evan

I'm a Fullstack developer passionate about building **responsive**, **dynamic** Web & Mobile applications with a strong focus on **scalability**, **performance**, and **cross-platform compatibility**.

Lately, I've been diving into the world of **AI** — exploring how it can seamlessly integrate with traditional programming to create smarter, more efficient development workflows.

---

- 🔭 I’m currently diving deep into **Automation** and **AI Tooling**.
- 🌱 Always learning something new, especially in the world of **integrations** and **developer tools**
- 💬 I love discussing **modern frameworks** like **Vue**, **Angular**, **React**, **Express**, **Fastify** and **Laravel**.
- 🤝 Open to collaborating on **open source projects** that push boundaries and solve real-world problems.
